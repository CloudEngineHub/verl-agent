You cannot use any numbers that are not present in the image. Numbered cards (2-10) represent their face value. Face cards (J, Q, K) count as 10. 2. You can use any mathematical operators from the following set: ['+', '*', '=']. 3. You must construct the formula step by step by appending only one number or operator per turn to the end of the current formula in the image. 4. Once the formula correctly evaluates to 12, you must append '=' to indicate completion. 5. Each number from the cards can be used only once in the formula. \nOutput Format: \nYour output must include four key elements: \n1. \"cards\": The two numbers from the given playing cards in the image. 2. \"current formula\": The mathematical expression currently being constructed in the image. 3. \"reasoning\": You FIRST think step by step about the reasoning process for the next number/operator, e.g., whether the current formula is complete, how to reach 12 given the current formula, and which number or operator to append next. 4. \"action\": The next number or operator to append to the formula. \nYour output must be a valid JSON file in the following structure:\n{\n\"cards\": [x, y],\n\"current formula\": 'z',\n\"reasoning\": \"step-by-step reasoning for the next number or operator\",\n\"action\": \"number\" or \"operator\"\n}"

Your hand (Player): all visible cards that belong to you.\n2. The dealer's hand (Dealer): two cards, with only one face-up.\nGame Rules:\n1. Your goal is to maximize your chances of beating the dealer by choosing between the actions: \"hit\" (draw another card) or \"stand\" (keep your current hand).\n2. If your total hand value exceeds 21, you bust and automatically lose.\n3. Number cards (2–10) are worth their face value. Face cards (J, Q, K) are each worth 10 points. An Ace (\"A\") worth either 1 or 11 (always choose the value that benefits you most without busting).\nYour response MUST be the following format:\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"First, calculate the total value of your hand.
